### This is place where I plan to store data applications I learned to make.

#### Dataset represent all the calls of people who called for animal resque.

#### Pie chart shows shares of call types per different dimensions. There is dropdown menu, so we can choose per which dimension we would like to see number of all calls.

#### Metric: Number of calls (i.e. its share).
#### Dimensions: Action Taken by Ranger, Age, Animal Health, Borough, Species, Species Status.

##### Application is made after watching youtube tutorial which can be found using following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV51JqP6y_Q .
